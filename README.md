# Activity-Recognition using motion sensors

The aim of the project was to create a classifier able to recognize four different arm movements when performed by a patient recovering from a stroke. Experimental results, after training a K-Means classifier, have shown impressive outcomes for identifying the tasks performed, with an accuracy of 95%.
